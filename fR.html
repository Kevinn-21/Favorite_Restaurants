        <h1>Kevin's Favorite Restaurants</h1>
        <p>This website contains a list of all of Kevin's favorite restaurants.
            Something to know about Kevin is that he lives in San Francisco, California.
            However, that doesn't mean that <em>all</em> of his favorite restaurants are in San Francisco!
            He likes restaurants all over the bay area and even the whole state. He has never
            really traveled to other states besides Hawaii and that was a long time ago, so there
            aren't going to be any restaurants in the top 5 from Hawaii.
