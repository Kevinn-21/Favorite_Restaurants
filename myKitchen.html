        <h1>My Kitchen</h1>
        <p>I don't normally cook, but my mom is a great cook and her cooking is what
            makes my kitchen a really good restaurant. She makes the best Vietnamese foods.
            Because of her, I never find the craving to eat Vietnamese food other than hers.
            This philosophy goes the same for any other food. I usually cook the foods that 
            I can make better than restaurants. For example, if I want pancakes, I make them at home.
            I never find the need to eat pancakes outside because I already make them pretty decently
            at home and at a cheaper price.
